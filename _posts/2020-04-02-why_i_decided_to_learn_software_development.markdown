I've always been very curious about the world around me and how it works; how a seed grows into a tree, why certain chemicals have the reaction that they do, to what those errors that pop up on my computer screen mean and everything in between. I've always been very analytical and had an attraction to things that to me seemed complex. Software Development always invoked the same feeling I had the first time I got a Rubix cube as a kid. It's a very simple toy, with very many paths you can take to solve it, but at first glance seems overly complex until you spend enough time learning it and master it. This is software development to me and partially the reason why I decided apply for this course at Flatiron.

My passion and want for learning languages started with the release of Pokemon Blue in the early 90s. As a latino kid having grown up only learning Spanish, playing this game proved a challenge to me as I couldn't understand it; English was foreign to me. I even tried calling the Nintendo support number on the back of the old Gameboys only to find out they also spoke English. It was at this point that I encouraged my mother to purchase cable television channels from America so that I could learn (English was only spoken by a fraction of the population at this point in the 90s). I dedicated 8 years to getting proficient enough to where I could fire back up that Gameboy and end my journey by catching all 151 Pokemon. To this day it's still one of the biggest accomplishments in my life as it's also served to open many opportunities in my life, such as the one I'm currently in with Flatiron. 

Acquiring English as a second language has allowed me to learn many skillsets, wear many hats in the professional job industry, travel the world and meet many insteresting people. It's this contrast to computer language that has always piqued my interest in computers and its sciences. I worked as a Signal Support Systems Specialists in my late teens with the Army and now as an IT Engineer for many years. They've only served to push me more and more towards that thirst for knowledge, challenge, that I've always had that I've always known could only be quenched by Software Development. 
We all know what it's like to have to call a company's support team to fix an issue, have to Google the answer because you have no control over what the program does or how it works internally. 

My professional life has been filled with finding solutions to other people's programs and platforms but it's never been enough. I want to build those programs, those platforms, understand how they work internally, have that first hand experience of building something from the ground up or help progress the development of something further. 

I believe this is my calling.
